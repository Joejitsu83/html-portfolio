<h1>The best movies of all time! (According to Joe)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Braveheart</h3>
<p>This is just a beautiful movie in every way, a little violent though..</p>
<h3>Indiana Jones</h3>
<p>You really can't go wrong as long as you're watching the original trilogy.</p>
<h3>Out Cold</h3>
<p>This is a raunchy snowboarding comedy, it reminds me of home.</p>
